# Fruit Schema Watcher

This is an application that watches a Mongo DB to provide the latest *schema* **

** Mongo is of course *schemaless* but that's relatively useless for GraphQL and in turn, we obviously have some type of schema available per the documents themselves. Thus, that is usedfor this purpose.
